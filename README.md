# Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Data Analysis and Visualization Project**! This repository contains code for analyzing a dataset, handling missing values, and visualizing correlations between different features. The project leverages Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to perform data preprocessing and create insightful visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **`analysis.py`**: Main Python script that loads the dataset, performs data preprocessing (including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables), calculates the correlation matrix, and visualizes the results as a heatmap.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the repository.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies for easy installation.
- **`correlation_matrix_heatmap.png`**: Saved heatmap image file showing the correlation between various features in the dataset.

## Features

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values by filling in median values for numerical columns and mode values for categorical columns.
2. **Encoding**: Converts categorical columns to numerical values for analysis.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Calculates and visualizes the correlation matrix of the dataset.
4. **Visualization Saving**: Saves the generated heatmap as an image file in the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-visualization.git
   cd data-analysis-visualization
   ```

2. **Run the analysis script**:

   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

   This will execute the analysis, fill missing values, convert categorical columns, generate a correlation matrix, and save the heatmap as `correlation_matrix_heatmap.png`.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to run the analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
from analysis import run_analysis  # Assuming you've structured the script as a function

df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
run_analysis(df)
```

## Output

The output heatmap will be saved as **`correlation_matrix_heatmap.png`** in the current directory. This visualization provides insights into how features are correlated with each other, helping in understanding the relationships within the dataset.
